🚀 Just wrapped up an interactive sales dashboard built entirely in Excel!

 Using real-world e-commerce data, I explored product performance, customer insights, and sales trends across countries and channels.
 
🔍 Key insights: • Top-performing product categories

 • Identification of top-performing product categories and SKUs
 
 • Analysis of return behavior segmented by countries
 
 • Trends in order priorities and shipment efficiency
 
 • Breakdown of sales by online vs in-store channels
 
📊 Tools used: Pivot Tables | Dynamic Charts | Conditional Formatting
